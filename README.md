# Home Assistant MTA Subway Service Status Sensor

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

## Overview

A sensor to provide MTA Subway service statuses for Home Assistant. The sensor reads from the offical [MTA Service Status](http://web.mta.info/status/ServiceStatusSubway.xml) XML feed and provides both the overall line status as a sensor state as well as status descriptions as sensor attributes. The train line states are updated every minute from the MTA feed.

Credit for the line icons goes to [louh](https://github.com/louh) and his great [NYC Subway Icons repo](https://github.com/louh/nyc-subway-icons) (used with some slight renaming).
